> Spec: Excel File Upload and Parsing
> Created: 2025-09-02

## Overview

Implement Excel file upload and parsing functionality that processes multi-sheet spreadsheets with validation to serve as the foundation for expense tracking. This feature enables users to upload their bank statement Excel files and have the system accurately parse transaction data from multiple sheets while validating data integrity.

## User Stories

### File Upload and Processing

As a personal finance user, I want to upload my multi-sheet Excel expense files, so that I can import all my transaction data from different bank accounts in one operation.

The user selects an Excel file (.xlsx) through a file picker, the system validates the file format and structure, parses all sheets to extract transaction data, and provides feedback on successful parsing or validation errors.

### Data Validation and Error Handling

As a user, I want clear feedback when my Excel file has formatting issues, so that I can fix the data and successfully import my transactions.

The system checks for required columns, validates date formats, identifies missing data, and provides specific error messages with sheet and row references for any issues found.

### Multi-Sheet Support

As a user with multiple bank accounts, I want the system to process all sheets in my Excel file, so that I can consolidate transactions from different sources in one upload.

The system automatically detects and processes all transaction sheets, handles summary sheets separately, and combines data while maintaining source sheet identification.

## Spec Scope

1. **File Upload Interface** - Drag-and-drop and file picker for .xlsx files with progress indication
2. **SheetJS Integration** - Parse Excel files with support for multi-sheet workbooks and formula evaluation
3. **Data Validation** - Validate required columns, date formats, and numeric amounts with error reporting
4. **Transaction Parsing** - Extract transaction data from sheets while handling various date and amount formats
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error messages with specific sheet/row references for troubleshooting

## Out of Scope

- CSV file support (Excel only for MVP)
- File conversion or export functionality
- Automatic bank account detection
- Transaction categorization (handled by separate AI feature)
- Data persistence (handled by separate storage feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully upload .xlsx files through an intuitive interface and see parsing progress
2. System accurately parses multi-sheet Excel files with transaction data from various bank formats
3. Clear validation errors are displayed with specific locations when files have formatting issues
