Monthly Expense Tracker is a smart financial dashboard that helps individuals consolidate spending data from multiple bank accounts by providing AI-powered transaction categorization and personalized budget optimization insights.

Monthly Expense Tracker serves personal finance enthusiasts and multi-account users who track expenses in Excel spreadsheets. Unlike traditional banking apps that require account linking, we provide AI-powered categorization and insights while processing Excel files locally, ensuring complete privacy control and working with data before bank statements are available.
